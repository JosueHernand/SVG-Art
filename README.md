# SVG-Art

## Description

As a freelance web developer, my motivation behind this project was to create a logo generator that enables me to design unique logos for my web projects without the ongoing expense of hiring a graphic designer. I built this tool to efficiently address the frequent need for logos in my work, allowing me to streamline my workflow and focus on core web development tasks. I gained a deeper understanding of SVG manipulation and user interaction through the Inquirer package, which improved my coding skills and project management abilities. This tool not only saves money but also equips me with a valuable skill set, enhancing my self-reliance, creativity, and efficiency in my freelance work.
